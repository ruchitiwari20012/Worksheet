Q15:- What is the difference between find() and find_all() in Beautiful Soup?

The find_all() method scans the entire document looking for results, but sometimes you only want to find one result. 
If you know a document only has one <body> tag, it’s a waste of time to scan the entire document looking for more. 
Rather than passing in limit=1 every time you call find_all, you can use the find() method
