Q11 :- What is Deep Learning?

Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example.
Deep learning is a key technology behind driverless cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign, or to distinguish a pedestrian 
from a lamppost. It is the key to voice control in consumer devices like phones, tablets, TVs, and hands-free speakers. Deep learning
is getting lots of attention lately and for good reason. It’s achieving results that were not possible before.

In deep learning, a computer model learns to perform classification tasks directly from images, text, or sound. Deep learning models 
can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, sometimes exceeding human-level performance. Models are trained by using a large set of labeled 
data and neural network architectures that contain many layers.

Q12 :- What is reinforcement learning?

Reinforcement learning is an area of Machine Learning. It is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. 
It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation. 
Reinforcement learning differs from the supervised learning in a way that in supervised learning the training data has the answer key
with it so the model is trained with the correct answer itself whereas in reinforcement learning, there is no answer but the reinforcement
agent decides what to do to perform the given task. In the absence of a training dataset, it is bound to learn from its experience.

Q14 :-What is a perceptron?

A perceptron is a simple binary classification algorithm, proposed by Cornell scientist Frank Rosenblatt. It helps to divide a
set of input signals into two parts—“yes” and “no”. But unlike many other classification algorithms, the perceptron was modeled
after the essential unit of the human brain—the neuron and has an uncanny ability to learn and solve complex problems.

A perceptronis a very simple learning machine. It can take in a few inputs, each of which has a weight to signify how important it is,and
generate an output decision of “0” or “1”. However, when combined with many other perceptrons, it forms an artificial neural 
network. A neural network can, theoretically, answer any question, given enough training data and computing power.
